How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by looking at the requirements and then organizing all the tools I need to complete them. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I've learned 3d graphics skills through this project, including texturing, animation, and lighting.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I plan to learn more modern game engines and will apply my skills there. For example, the engine I am currently learning uses meshes in a similar way to OpenGL.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by making sure my code is adaptable, readable, and has as few errors and vulnerabilities as possible.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I made sure to keep my code as organized as possible and follow a simple pattern. For example, my uRender function would have the same order and flow for each mesh that was rendered in.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a factor in texturing and lighting. I had to create a loop for textures to show up, and respectively for the lighting to hit the textures.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My appraoch to developing coode was simply gaining a better understanding of what I was doing. I started by looking at the tutorial code with zero idea of what was written on the screen. This project forced me to sit down and study the code for hours in order to build upon it.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to become a software engineer, particularly in game development. Computer science and especially this class help me learn every step of what it takes to get into the field and use my skills creatively.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I can use computational graphics to expand on future classes such as Full Stack Development I and II, where I will be creating fully-fledged programs. Knowing graphics can help me incorporate 3D aspects into the designs of whatever I create in future classes.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computer graphics will help me in my professional goals of becoming a game developer.
